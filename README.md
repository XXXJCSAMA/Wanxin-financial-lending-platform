# Wanxin-financial-lending-platform
This project includes two parts: trading platform and business support
Wanxin Finance, developed in this course, is a financial platform providing financial services and personal consumer credit services to the Internet public, relying on big data risk control
Technology, to provide users with convenient, fast, secure P2P financial services. This project includes two parts: trading platform and business support. The trading platform is mainly implemented
Current financial services, including: lending, lending and other modules, business support includes: target management, reconciliation management, risk control management and other modules. The project adopts advanced
The research and development of Internet technology ensures the security, speed and stability of P2P transactions.
At present, the state has increasingly strict monitoring and normative control over the P2P industry, and has introduced many policies to regulate it. The "capital pool model" and "third-party payment custody" (see the definition below) previously adopted by P2P platforms are no longer compliant, and the state advocates the "bank deposit model" to avoid the risk of P2P platforms misappropriating borrowers' funds. Through the "bank depository system" developed by the bank to manage investors' funds, each P2P platform user will have an independent account in the bank's depository system, and the P2P platform will manage the transactions, so that the funds and transactions are separated, so that the P2P platform cannot access the funds, which can avoid the risk of funds being misappropriated to a certain extent.
What is the pool model?
In this mode, investors use the third-party payment/bank channel to first transfer funds to the platform's bank account. P2P platform is like a pool, gathering funds from investors and borrowers. This pool of funds is called a capital pool, which is the easiest mode for P2P platforms to run away from.
What is the third-party payment hosting model?
In this model, investors/borrowers must register in addition to the P2P platform, but also in the third-party payment platform, that is, the platform and the third party each have a set
The account system. After the funds are managed by the third-party payment, the deposit of the funds occurs on the third-party payment's reserve fund account in the bank, and the P2P platform operates
The party can only see the changes in the investor/borrower account balance and the creditor's right matching relationship, and can not embezzle the investor's money like the fund pool, but it is stored here
Among the security risks are third-party payment institutions.
What is the bank depository model?
In this mode, there are two sets of account systems involved, one for the P2P platform and one for the bank. After investors register in the P2P platform, they will jump to the bank at the same time
The bank opens another electronic account, and there is a corresponding relationship between the two accounts.
